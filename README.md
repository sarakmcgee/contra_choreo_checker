* Course: CS 5001



## Description 
General overview of the project, what you did, why you did it, etc.

This tool builds a contra dance from a set of choreography figures  via user input and verifies that the length of those figures fits the timing of each phrase and that the final position of each dancer allows both couples to progress through the set and interact with a new pair. 

## Key Features
Highlight some key features of this project that you want to show off/talk about/focus on. 

## Guide
How do we run your project? What should we do to see it in action? - Note this isn't installing, this is actual use of the project.. If it is a website, you can point towards the gui, use screenshots, etc talking about features.

This program can be run from the command line with no arguments. The default user flow directly initiates dance-building, eliciting user input to select figures, During this process, the user may also list acceptable figures by typing "list" or "list figures", see the dancers' current position by typing "dancers position" or "dancers" or "positions", or remove the most recently added figure by typing "remove" or "delete". Futhermore, the user may leave the program using "exit" or "quit", or consult additional info by typing "help".

Please note, this program must be run with the terminal navigated to the folder which contains the figure descriptions text file, in order to preserve the relative path by which it will be accessed.


## Installation Instructions

No major requirements, just clone the repository. You will need the program itself (contra_choreo_checker.py), the Contra_Dance, Figure, and Dancer class files and the figure_description text file.

## Code Review
Go over key aspects of code in this section. Both link to the file, include snippets in this report (make sure to use the [coding blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).  Grading wise, we are looking for that you understand your code and what you did. 

### Major Challenges
Key aspects could include pieces that your struggled on and/or pieces that you are proud of and want to show off.


## Example Runs
Explain how you documented running the project, and what we need to look for in your repository (text output from the project, small videos, links to videos on youtube of you running it, etc)

## Testing
How did you test your code? What did you do to make sure your code was correct? If you wrote unit tests, you can link to them here. If you did run tests, make sure you document them as text files, and include them in your submission. 

> _Make it easy for us to know you *ran the project* and *tested the project* before you submitted this report!_


## Missing Features / What's Next
Focus on what you didn't get to do, and what you would do if you had more time, or things you would implement in the future. 

## Final Reflection
Write at least a paragraph about your experience in this course. What did you learn? What do you need to do to learn more? Key takeaways? etc.
